# BCS Week 4, Code Quiz using JS

## Getting Started

This project involved creating a quiz for my fellow coders. This week we needed to really utilize our previous lessons in HTML and CSS and add in our new knowledge of JS and API.
I found the HTML and CSS creation were quite easier this week now that there is a baseline of knowledge of our you want to section your different parts of your page, and coincide it 
within your stylesheet. The creating of our own JS this week was a feat and I relied heavily on tutoring, watching previous classes, youtube, chatgpt, and google.

I started the whole process, with a very basic outline of what I wanted each file to store, making comments through out the page of how I wanted something to function or look.

The HTML and CSS plan was very basic, with the importance put into my JS file to make sure the functionality of the quiz worked for the user. After the tutoring I decided to have 
my questions live within JS and I would create/append my DOM, as opposed to having them live in my DOM and allowing my JS to hide them and show them after each funciton.

## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Issues Created / Solutions

  1. Create HTML file.
  2. Create CSS Stylesheet.
  3. Create JS file.
  4. Create README.md
  5. Test going through the quiz, making sure it tallies correctly, and adds info to my local storage.
  6. Go through html and javascript files to check for redundancies or places where you can condense elements.
  7. Deployment.
